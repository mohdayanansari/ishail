					'High altitude refers to geographical locations situated at elevations typically exceeding 2,500 meters (8,000 feet) above sea level. At these elevated positions, the atmospheric pressure is lower than at sea level, leading to a reduced density of air molecules. As a consequence, the partial pressure of oxygen in the air decreases, resulting in limited oxygen availability for breathing and gas exchange in the lungs. As a result, the oxygen content available for breathing is reduced, which can significantly impact the environment and physiology of living organisms, including humans.',
					'In addition, high altitude environments are characterized by notable temperature fluctuations, resulting in cold or freezing conditions. The thinner atmosphere at higher elevations allows for stronger solar radiation, enabling more ultraviolet (UV) rays to penetrate. This heightened UV exposure increases the risk of sunburn and potential skin damage. Moreover, these regions are prone to exposure to strong winds, especially at mountain peaks and ridges, which combined with varying precipitation patterns, can lead to increased rainfall or snowfall.',
